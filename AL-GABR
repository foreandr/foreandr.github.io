Each round, a player (or AI) secretly chooses a mathematical structure — something like a group, a ring, a field, a vector space, a manifold, etc.
You, the guesser, don’t know what it is.

You can only ask yes/no questions about its axioms and properties.

Examples:

“Do I have an identity element?”

“Is multiplication associative?”

“Do I have additive inverses?”

“Is my multiplication commutative?”

“Do I have distributivity over addition?”

“Do I have a topology?”

Each question splits the search space — like moving down a decision tree of algebraic structures.
You eliminate impossibilities until you narrow it down to one.

Your goal:

Deduce exactly which structure you are, using pure logical inference.

🧠 What Makes It Fun

It feels like a logic puzzle and a game of 20 Questions at once.

Every yes/no answer builds a taxonomy of structures — a live mental map of algebra.

It scales: you can play simple (group vs. ring) or advanced (Lie algebra vs. manifold with connection).

Each question deepens your grasp of why structures differ — by what axioms define them.

💡 Core Idea

It’s not trivia — it’s axiom deduction.
You’re not recalling definitions, you’re reasoning through them interactively.

Essentially:

A game where you rediscover the structure of mathematics by asking the universe about its laws.

Would you like me to write out a short version of that (like a store/game blurb — 100 words max, catchy but serious)?
