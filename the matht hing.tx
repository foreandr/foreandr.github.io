instead of thinking as it as a graph with dependencies, we should really think about it as a kind of flow chart maybe? where there is a binary choie for each axioms yes or no
    is this a map, is it linear, and the question is it linear has 3 binary chpoices inside it and so one
    like those memes about "is this in your control yes or no etc etcv"
