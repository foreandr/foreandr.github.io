Hey, good morning. I would like to do a double blind astrology test with you. So there are 12 signs. I need you to get 12 traits from all of the signs in a way that kind of more or less makes them mutually exclusive. So Leo's are said, I don't believe in astrology, but they're said to have different traits than Scorpio's and Sagittarius and whatever the rest of them are. So get 10 traits from each of the 12. There should be 120 traits in total. But then I don't want you to say which traits come from which sign. I want you to memorize that internally and write them in a way that there's a secret code to yourself that we can kind of verify that you knew ahead of time where the traits were going to be. Because you could imagine, you know, you put the traits down and it ends up in such and such a way and then post hoc, you kind of decide that they fit the narrative that you want. We don't want to do that. We want you to have picked the traits ahead of time. And then I'm going to, after you've done this, so list them all out. And then I'm going to rank my disposition to each of them in a scale of one to 10 and see if that fits this typical description of a person who has whatever my sign is. This way we can know that there's no bias in the system.
